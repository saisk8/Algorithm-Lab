For adjacency list and min heap algorithm: 
N Value      Time Taken     
10        : 0.000003       
100       : 0.000105       
1000      : 0.011832       
10000     : 0.460850       
For adjacency matrix and min heap algorithm: 
N Value      Time Taken     
10        : 0.000003       
100       : 0.000123       
1000      : 0.011725       
It therefore, can be concluded that the Dijkstra program using the Adjacency List and 
Min-Heap, run faster on average than the one using the Adjacency Matrix and Min-Heap.



Note: Kindly note that an input size of 10,000 could not be given to the Adjacency Matrix probelm due to
the stack overflow problem that may occur in many systems...
 The size of the matrix is too large to be allocated on the stack memory
